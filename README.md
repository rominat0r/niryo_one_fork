# Niryo One Fork


Here we are using Arduino and CNC board instead of raspberry pi. Also instead of motors from Robotis we are going to use MG995.

This repository contains STL files to print Niryo One with a 3D printer.

Note : **You need at least a 200mm\*200mm\*200mm 3D printer to be able to print all the parts.**

You can find Niryo One ROS stack here : https://github.com/NiryoRobotics/niryo_one_ros 
This fork is meant to be truly open source, meaning that all parts should be easy to find and buy. 

Enjoy !

Note : if you have received your Niryo One before September 2018, the files related to your robot are located in the "Archive (v 1.1.0)" folder.
